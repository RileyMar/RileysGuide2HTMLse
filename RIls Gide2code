    <h2><p style="color:white">Background color</h2>
    
    <p><p style="color:white">Background color is an essential element to get the mood of your website across. The command is &lt;body style="background-color:black;"> and replacing the word black with another color makes it a different color.</p>
    
    <h2><p style="color:white">Text Color</h2>
    
    <p><p style="color:white"> In order to change text color, all you need to do is enter in this simple command:&lt;p style="color:white"> before the text that needs coloring, and only one is required. In order to get a different color than white, you just need to replace the word white with the color you want. (fun fact:tomato is a color)</p>
    
    <h2><p style="color:white">Moving Text</h2>
    
    <p><p style="color:white">Now, I know youve all been wondering how I made my moving title. Here it is! The command is like the paragraph command, but instead of &lt;/p> and &lt;p>, it is &lt;marquee> and &lt;/marquee>. All of these effects are compatible with eachother as well.</p>
    
    <h2><p style="color:white">Divider Line</h2>
    
    <p><p style="color:white"> In order to make a divider line like the one at the top of the pace, the  command is &lt;hr>. The color of the line is dependent on the surrounding text color. Only one of these is required to make the line, so &lt;/hr> is not a valid command.</p>
